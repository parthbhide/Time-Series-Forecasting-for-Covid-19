# Time-Series-Forecasting-For-Covid-19
Forecasting Covid-19 Cases in India

### Aim
  To build a model that can predict the values of upcomming Covid-19 cases provided the timeseries of 
  already confirmed datewise cases in India.
  The approach used in this project can be exteded to statewise data to get statewise predictions.
      
### Methodology
  1. Gathering data from API ( 'https://api.covid19india.org/csv/latest/state_wise_daily.csv' ) and preprocessing.
  2. Analysing if current time series is stationary or not using **Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test.**
  3. Converting the series into stationary using **differencing** method.
  4. Analysing ACF and PACF and tuinning values of **p,d,q.**
  5. Using our model to predict the values of the current timeseries and comparing it with orignal data.
  6. Forecasting and plotting values for future.
  
  
### Results
